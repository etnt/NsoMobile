# NSO Mobile
> Android App for getting data from a Cisco NSO system

This is a very experimental Android App that can retrieve
some data from a running Cisco NSO system over the RESTCONF
interface.

Mainly it is an exercise in how to build an Android App using
Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.

However, with release 0.2.0 it may actually be useful for some people.

A video demo of Nso-Mobile can be found [here](https://youtu.be/HsOm8Tvw75E?si=_nGcllmQeCNrTdbt).

## StickyHeader

I introduced a stickyHeader effect when scrolling the device list.
Look at the demo [here](https://youtu.be/XHlT5SGGUPg?si=WuBUTA5nxJmdMEf6).

## Adding Release Notes

Adding release notes to the app was surprisingly tricky.
A video explaining how it was done can be found [here](https://youtu.be/NFUxl8V0P0k).
